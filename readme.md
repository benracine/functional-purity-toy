## Functional purity

This is just a little exploration into how easy or hard it is to separate JavaScript(/node) code into a collection of mostly pure little functions.

Any and all comments welcome.

I recently updated it be more ES6 friendly.

I also wrapped it up into what is kinda sorta OO code, but not really. 

## Quick start

`$ npm install`

`$ npm start`

## TODO

Things I really should add:
- Tests
