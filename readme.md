## Functional purity meets OO

This is basically just a tiny exploration into using lexical closures as a minimum viable language feature to start to code in an object-oriented style.

The source code is in `countStates.js`. The text file, `homesteading-cities.txt`, is filled with comments from a social media thread discussing where they are a particular group of homesteaders are pursuing their plans. The `states.json` file is populated with the US states and their abbreviations. 

## Quick start

`$ npm install`

`$ npm start`

Some internal tests should pass. 

You should find out which states might be best for homesteading. Or, at least ones that are popular in one particular social media group.
